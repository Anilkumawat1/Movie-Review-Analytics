Data Limitations: The dataset used for analysis contained only 10,000 records, which is quite small. Cleaning the data and removing null values reduced the dataset even further. This limitation makes it challenging to draw reliable conclusions because of the limited amount of data.

Missing Data in 'revenue_adj' and 'budget_adj' Columns: Almost half of the values in these columns were zeros, which made it difficult to scale or compute averages accurately. This missing data affected the reliability of the dataset.

Noise in the Data: Despite attempts to remove outliers, there was still some noise in the dataset, making it less precise.

Conclusions:

Movie Budget and Revenue: There is a significant correlation between a movie's budget and its revenue. Generally, movies with higher budgets tend to perform better financially. However, the limited data and missing values make this conclusion less reliable.

Popularity and Revenue: Popularity and revenue are positively correlated. It's logical that more popular movies tend to generate higher revenue, and the data supports this idea.

Director Influence on Revenue: Movies directed by Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg, and Michael Bay tend to have higher revenue compared to those by other directors. However, this doesn't mean all famous directors generate the highest revenue, as this conclusion is based on limited data.

Trends in Movie Revenue: There was a revenue spike in the mid-1960s to 1980s, followed by a drop to around $200 million. However, this observation isn't very reliable due to the significant missing data during the 1960s to 1980s.

Exploring Trends in the Data:

Popular Movie Genres: Drama and Comedy are the most popular movie genres overall.

Voter Count and Average Vote: Voter count has increased over the years, but the average vote has gradually declined since the mid-1970s.

Top Directors: Directors like Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, and Ridley Scott have directed more movies than others. Interestingly, Peter Jackson, who directed the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, generated the most revenue among them.

In summary, while these conclusions and trends provide some insights into the dataset, it's important to remember that the limited and noisy data may affect the reliability of these findings.
